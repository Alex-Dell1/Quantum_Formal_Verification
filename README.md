# Formal Verification of Quantum Systems
Here you can find a report I made for a university course on Formal Verification. The topic I chose is Formal Verification of Quantum System, based on the paper _"Formal Verification of Quantum Programs: Theory, Tools and Challenges"_ by Marco Lewis, Sadegh Soudjani, Paolo Zuliani.

The paper is a survey that introduces the reader to a large variety of different solutions adopted in the field. I had thus to make a selection of the topics I wanted to present. These are Quantum CTL, Quantum Hoare Logic and Quantum Weakest Precondition.
