# Formal Verification of Quantum Systems
Here you can find a report I made for a university course on Formal Verification. The topic I chose is Formal Verification of Quantum Systems, based on the paper _"Formal Verification of Quantum Programs: Theory, Tools and Challenges"_ by Marco Lewis, Sadegh Soudjani, Paolo Zuliani.

The paper is a survey that introduces the reader to a large variety of different solutions adopted in the field. Thus, (not in a light-hearted way) I had to make a selection of the topics I wanted to present. These are Quantum CTL, Quantum Floyd-Hoare Logic and Quantum Weakest Precondition.

Here you can find the report I produced as a result of my studies, as well as the slides for the seminar I held about them.
